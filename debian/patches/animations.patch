Description: Ensure animations work with newer versions of mutter
 v3.28.3+git20190124-0ubuntu18.04.1 and later versions of mutter
 introduce clutter optimisations that break budgie animations.
 This patch forces clutter.actor redrawing to ensure screen painting
 is fully redrawn so that screen artifacts are not left behind due
 to paint areas not correctly being marked as damaged.
