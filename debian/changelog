budgie-desktop (10.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Bug fix release
    - add patch gsd.patch (Closes: #869953)
      Where gnome-settings-daemon version is greater than
      libmutter, the build of budgie-desktop results in an
      invalid gnome-session file.  The patch ensures a valid file
      is created by checking the version of gnome-settings-daemon
      instead of mutter during the build.
   * Packaging Changes:
     - debian/control: Add build dependency for gnome-settings-daemon-dev
       to ensure the patch can determine the version correctly
     - debian/control: Fix the Vcs-Git location typo bugie --> budgie
